# HOW TO COMPILE AND EXECUTE .java FILE

Basically to compile and execute the .java we need to set the path by using either set path in cmd which is temporary or enviroment variable in system's properties option i.e. permanent.
javac command is used to compile .java file that will give us a .class file(it contains byte code) to run this .class file java command is used.
For example how can we execute Test.java file.
go to the directory where you put this file through cmd
  first step set path=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_201\bin
    javac Test.java
    java Test
